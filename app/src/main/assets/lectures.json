    "description": "Decompose complex rational functions into simpler fractions to enable integration.",
    "content": "Integration by partial fractions is a powerful method used to evaluate complex rational functions—fractions in which both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials. The technique involves decomposing a complicated fraction into a sum of simpler fractions, called *partial fractions*, which can then be integrated individually. Essentially, this method reverses the process of adding rational expressions.\n\n**Core Concept: Partial Fraction Decomposition**\nThe main idea behind partial fraction decomposition is that any *proper rational function* can be expressed as a sum of simpler fractions. A rational function is considered *proper* if the degree of its numerator is less than the degree of its denominator. If the function is *improper* (the numerator's degree is equal to or greater than that of the denominator), polynomial long division must first be applied to simplify it.\n\nOnce simplified, the denominator is factored into linear and/or irreducible quadratic factors. The specific form of the partial fraction decomposition depends on the nature of these factors.\n\n**Common Forms of Partial Fractions:**\n1. Distinct linear factors: (px + q)/[(x - a)(x - b)] = A/(x - a) + B/(x - b)\n2. Repeated linear factors: (px + q)/(x - a)² = A/(x - a) + B/(x - a)²\n3. Irreducible quadratic factors: (px² + qx + r)/[(x - a)(x² + bx + c)] = A/(x - a) + (Bx + C)/(x² + bx + c)\n\n**Steps for Integration by Partial Fractions**\n1. **Check if the function is proper.** For a given rational function ∫[P(x)/Q(x)] dx, determine whether it is proper. If the degree of P(x) is greater than or equal to that of Q(x), perform polynomial long division to rewrite the expression as a polynomial plus a proper rational function.\n2. **Factor the denominator.** Completely factor the denominator Q(x) into linear and/or irreducible quadratic factors.\n3. **Decompose the function.** Based on the factored form of Q(x), express the function as a sum of partial fractions with unknown coefficients.\n4. **Determine the unknown coefficients.** Combine the terms in the partial fraction decomposition and equate the numerators of both sides. Solve for the unknown coefficients either by equating coefficients of like powers of x or by substituting convenient values for x.\n5. **Integrate the partial fractions.** Once the decomposition is complete, integrate each term separately.\n\n**Example:** ∫dx/(x² - 1)\nFactor denominator: x² - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\nDecompose: 1/[(x - 1)(x + 1)] = A/(x - 1) + B/(x + 1)\nSolve for A and B: A = 1/2, B = -1/2\n∫dx/(x² - 1) = (1/2)∫[1/(x - 1) - 1/(x + 1)] dx = (1/2)[ln|x - 1| - ln|x + 1|] + C = (1/2)ln|(x - 1)/(x + 1)| + C"

    "content": "## 7.1 Definition of Definite Integral\n\nA definite integral is the area under a curve between two fixed limits. The definite integral is represented as ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx, where a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit, for a function f(x), defined with reference to the x-axis. To find the area under a curve between two limits, we divide the area into rectangles and sum them up. The more the number of rectangles, the more accurate the area is. So we divide the area into an infinite number of rectangles each with the same (very small) size and add all the areas. This is the fundamental theory that lies behind definite integrals.\n\nDefinite integral helps to find the area of a curve in a graph. It has limits: the start and the endpoints within which the area under a curve is calculated. Assume that the limit points are [a, b] to find the area of the curve f(x) with respect to the x-axis.\n\nThis integral represents the net area under the curve, where the area above the x-axis is considered positive and the area below the x-axis is negative.\n\nMathematically, the definite integral is defined as the limit of a Riemann sum:\n\n∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx = limₙ→∞ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ f(xᵢ*) Δx\n\nWhere Δx = (b - a)/n and xᵢ* is any point in the subinterval [xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ].\n\n## 7.2 Properties of Definite Integrals\n\nLet f(x) and g(x) be continuous functions on [a, b], and let k be a constant:\n1. ∫ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0\n2. ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx = -∫ᵇₐ f(x) dx\n3. ∫ₐᵇ [f(x) + g(x)] dx = ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx + ∫ₐᵇ g(x) dx\n4. ∫ₐᵇ kf(x) dx = k∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx\n5. ∫ₐᶜ f(x) dx + ∫꜀ᵇ f(x) dx = ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx\n\n## 7.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects differentiation and integration:\n\n**First Part:**\nIf f(x) is continuous on [a, b], and F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), then\n∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\n**Second Part:**\nIf F(x) = ∫ₐˣ f(t) dt, then F'(x) = f(x)\n\n## 7.4 Evaluating Definite Integrals\n\nTo evaluate a definite integral, find the antiderivative F(x) of the integrand f(x), then apply the limits of integration:\n∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\n**Example 7.1:** ∫₀² 3x² dx = [x³]₀² = 8 - 0 = 8\n**Example 7.2:** ∫₁⁴ (2x + 3) dx = [x² + 3x]₁⁴ = (16 + 12) - (1 + 3) = 28 - 4 = 24\n**Example 7.3:** ∫₀^π sin(x) dx = [-cos(x)]₀^π = 1 - (-1) = 2\n\n## 7.5 Geometric Interpretation of Definite Integrals\n\nThe definite integral can be interpreted as the signed area between the curve y = f(x) and the x-axis from x = a to x = b.\n\nIf f(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [a, b], then the definite integral represents the area under the curve.\nIf f(x) ≤ 0, then the integral represents the negative of the area below the x-axis.\n\n## 7.6 Applications of Definite Integrals\n\nDefinite integrals are widely used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics:\n1. Finding the area under a curve\n2. Calculating the displacement and distance traveled by an object\n3. Computing the volume and surface area of solids of revolution\n4. Determining the average value of a function over an interval\n\n**Example:** Find total distance traveled by a particle with velocity v(t) = 3t² + 2t from t = 0 to t = 2\ns = ∫₀² (3t² + 2t) dt = [t³ + t²]₀² = (8 + 4) - 0 = 12 units"

Applications include finding volume under surfaces, area of regions, mass, center of mass, and average value of functions over regions."
